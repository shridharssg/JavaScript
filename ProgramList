2. Fibonacci Series

function fibo(num){
    console.log('Fibonacci Series:');
    let n1=0, n2=1, nextTerm=0
    for(let i=1; i<=num; i++){
        console.log(n1) //print n1
        nextTerm=n1+n2;
        n1=n2;
        n2=nextTerm;
    }
}

fibo(5)

0 1 1 2 3

The for loop iterates up to the number entered by the user.

0 is printed at first. Then, in each iteration, the value of the second term is stored in variable n1 and the sum of two previous terms is stored in variable n2.
