Closures : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures

a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

function init() {
  var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, that forms the closure
    console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  displayName();
}
init();

init() creates a local variable called name and a function called displayName(). 
The displayName() function is an inner function that is defined inside init() and is available only within the body of the init() function. 
Note that the displayName() function has no local variables of its own. 
However, since inner functions have access to the variables of outer functions, displayName() can access the variable name declared in the parent function, init().

lexical scoping
console.log() statement within the displayName() function successfully displays the value of the name variable, which is declared in its parent function. This is an example of lexical scoping,

 A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared
