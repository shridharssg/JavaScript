Understanding Scope in JavaScript
Scope in JavaScript refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables. It determines where variables and functions are accessible in your code. There are two main types of scope: global scope and local scope.

1. Global Scope
Variables declared outside any function have a global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.


var globalVar = "I'm global";

function globalFunction() {
  console.log(globalVar); // Output: I'm global
}

globalFunction();

---

2. Local Scope
Variables declared within a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed outside of it.

function localFunction() {
  var localVar = "I'm local";
  console.log(localVar); // Output: I'm local
}

localFunction();
console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined

JavaScript also has block scope introduced with ES6, allowing variables to be scoped within blocks using let and const.

3. Block Scope
Variables declared with let or const within a block (e.g., inside an if statement or loop) are only accessible within that block.

if (true) {
  let blockVar = "I'm block scoped";
  console.log(blockVar); // Output: I'm block scoped
}

console.log(blockVar); // Error: blockVar is not defined
