closure

A closure is the combination of a function bundled(enclosed) together with its lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing functionâ€™s variables, functions and other data even after the outer function has finished its execution. The closure has three scope chains.

Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
Outer function's variables
Global variables
Let's take an example of closure concept,


function Welcome(name) {
  var greetingInfo = function (message) {
    console.log(message + " " + name);
  };
  return greetingInfo;
}
var myFunction = Welcome("John");
myFunction("Welcome "); //Output: Welcome John
myFunction("Hello Mr."); //output: Hello Mr. John
