this is not variable. it is keyword
this keyword always holds the reference to a single object which is depends on where we are referring.


example 2 :

	const Employee = {
	        firstName : 'sam';
    		lastName : 'karan';
		getFullName : function(){
			console.log(`fullName is ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName} `
		}
	}

	Employee.getFullName();   -> o/p: fullName is sam karan
		here this will pointing to Emplyoee object.
	

	Now clone the Employee object getFullName() method
	
	const getName = Employee.getFullName();

	console.log(getName());  o/p : fullName is undefined undefined


	Note: getName() is invoked without any dot operator or new operator. so this is pointing to global window object, thats why it is returning undefind for both firstname and lastname.
